The night may seem long,
but dawn always breaks.
Storms howl with fury,
yet calmness awakes.

Mountains loom high,
their peaks out of sight,
but step after step
you’ll reach the light.

Fear whispers lies,
but courage speaks true:
"You are much stronger
than you ever knew."

Keep walking forward,
heart burning bright—
through shadows and trials,
you’ll find your light.
