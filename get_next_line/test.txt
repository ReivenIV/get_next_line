1  The night may seem long,
2  but dawn always breaks.
3  Storms howl with fury,
4  yet calmness awakes.
5 
6  Mountains loom high,
7  their peaks out of sight,
8  but step after step
9  you’ll reach the light.
10 
11 Fear whispers lies,
12 but courage speaks true:
13 "You are much stronger
14 than you ever knew."

16 Keep walking forward,
17 heart burning bright—
18 through shadows and trials,
19 you’ll find your light.
